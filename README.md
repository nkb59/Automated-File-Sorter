# Automated-File-Sorter

This a Python Automated File Sorter that can be used to help organize file structures in a way that you choose.

You can insert a timer that would look something like this if you want to run it at a set interval or time:

while(True):
    check_price()
    time.sleep(86400)
    
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(r'/Users/niketanbaranwal/Downloads')

print(df)

Hope you enjoy :) 

Thanks!
